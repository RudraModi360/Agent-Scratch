## Usage

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
Run the agent interactively:
```bash
python Agent.py
```

#### CLI Commands
- `help`      â€“ Show help message
- `tools`     â€“ List available tools
- `history`   â€“ Show recent execution history
- `clear`     â€“ Clear chat history
- `status`    â€“ Show agent status
- `quit/exit` â€“ Exit the agent

Or simply type your request (e.g. "Create a Python web scraper for news headlines").

### Programmatic Usage
You can import and use the agent in your own Python scripts:
```python
from Agent import GeneralGroqAgent
agent = GeneralGroqAgent(groq_api_key)
result = agent.process_request("Write a Python script to sort a CSV file")
print(result['final_response'])
```

## Architecture & Main Classes

- **GeneralGroqAgent**: Main agent class. Handles request processing, planning, execution, and history.
- **GroqLLMEngine**: Integrates Groq LLM for analysis, planning, and content generation.
- **BaseTool**: Abstract base for all tools. Extend this to add new capabilities.
- **FileSystemTool**: File and directory operations.
- **EditFileTool**: Exact text replacement in files.
- **CommandTool**: System command execution.
- **WebTool**: Web requests and scraping.
- **DataProcessingTool**: Data analysis and transformation.
- **AgentCLI**: Interactive command-line interface.

## Tool System & Extensibility

Tools are modular and easy to extend. To add a new tool:
1. Subclass `BaseTool` and implement required methods (`name`, `description`, `parameters`, `execute`).
2. Add your tool to the agent:
   ```python
   agent.add_tool(MyNewTool())
   ```
3. The agent will automatically use it for relevant tasks.

## Current Tools

The agent comes with the following built-in tools:

| Tool Name         | Description                                              |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| filesystem        | File and directory operations (create, read, write, etc) |
| edit_file         | Exact text replacement in files                          |
| command           | System command execution                                 |
| web               | Web requests and basic web scraping                      |
| data_processing   | Data analysis and transformation (JSON, CSV, text)       |

You can list available tools in the CLI by typing `tools`.
